### Introduction

Throughout my academic career, I've always considered myself a procrastinator. Historically, it was never much an issue. In elementary, middle, and high school, I'd wait until the last week, day, even hour before something was due, then complete it, and somehow scrape by with a good grade. I always thought that it wasn't a big deal; I performed better under pressure, so why not wait? As I progressed further and further into my academic career, however, I had the epiphany that this was simply not true. As the stakes of my assignments and projects grew, so did the anxiety of waiting to tackle them. The "pressure" I thought motivated me now only paralyzed me, preventing me from being productive. Around second semester last year, I decided I needed to make a change.

### The Problem

The first step in changing behavior is identifying the root cause. This was harder than I initially thought. I cared deeply about my academics and was passionate about the subjects I studied. After a few weeks of conscious observation of my work habits, I came up with a theory. Whenever I decided to procrastinate/do something else instead of my work, I asked myself three questions:
1. Why am I choosing to do this?
2. What do I hope to achieve?
3. Why is this more tempting than doing work?

When I reflected back on these questions, I realized a common theme that I hadn't considered before, but was blatantly logical. The hours of procrastination and guilt typically stemmed from a harmless "quick break". I'd start an assignment, but get frustrated and take a brain break. Or, I'd take one before I started so I wouldn't be tempted to get distracted while I was supposed to be working. However, those quick "brain breaks" slipped into 30 minutes, an hour, two hours, or even longer.

### Brainstorming Solutions

The most difficult part of this process was brainstorming effective solutions. Nowadays, social media apps, streaming services, even texts and email, all bombard our brains with dopamine, providing massive amounts of instant gratification. Competing with that is a difficult task, not mentioning how integral procrastination was to my academic life. I quickly realized my goal shoudn't be to try and fully kick the procrastination habit, but improve little by little. At first, I tried to be conscious about when I'd fall into the pit of distraction. This worked for about a month, until the tempation to be distracted overcame my conscious effort. 

### Productive "Distraction"

Once I realized that kicking procrastination would be a much harder task than I initially thought, I decided to think about the problem from a different angle. Obviously, I needed to be more productive. However, me getting distracted was unavoidable. So, I decided to change what I got distracted with. The first step was making it more difficult for me to be distracted by the usual suspects (Instagram, Tiktok, etc). I installed an app called Opal, which is similar to the Apple screen time feature, but makes it much more difficult to access your apps. Every day from 9-5, I lock all of my non-essential apps on my phone. In order to access them, I need to go into the Opal app and wait an entire minute before I can "snooze" the app timeout. This way, I am conciously thinking about my intentions for a whole minute before I am able to access a potentially distracting app. This alone made my screen time decrease by hours each day. It's more inconvinent to wait the whole minute to be distracted than to realize that whatever I want to look at at that moment isn't really important.

### The Replacement

It was unrealistic for me to be purely focused on my schoolwork whenever I was working. I needed something else I could do during my breaks from my academic work. Since I was conciously trying not to go on my phone during this time, I needed something else to do. I thought it would be smart to work on things that I was passionate about, but not school-related. For example, learning the fundamentals of Linux, an open-source operating system widely used in the tech/software development field. I'd take my study breaks to research and work on these areas that interested me, but weren't really related to what I was working on. A good example of this was this project! I was struggling to come up with ideas for my blog post, so instead of giving up and succumbing to distraction I decided to employ these strategies I discussed. After a bit of thinking, I had an idea. I always wanted to create a personal portfolio website, but not something from a cookie cutter website builder, so I could demonstrate some of my potential programming experience to employers. I had to create a website-style blog post for this assignment as well. So, I decided to combine the two and create the website where the blog post would live. 

### Details

In order to create the website, I used a library called jekyll, which is an amazing tool for creating static, blog-style websites. It's based in the programming language Ruby, which I had no experience with, but it's so user-friendly anyone with a basic understanding of HTML and website design could use it. The best part, too, was that the blog posts supported markdown, a simple, aesthetically pleasing text formatting language that this blog post is written in! After struggling for a few minutes with missing dependencies, I was able to get the skeleton of the website running on my local machine.
